Base64 Encoding: A Complete Guide

Base64 encoding is a method of converting binary data into ASCII text format. Let's dive deep into how it works and when you should use it.

What is Base64?

Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into a text format using 64 different ASCII characters. It's commonly used for:
- Embedding images in HTML/CSS
- Encoding data in URLs
- Storing binary data in text-based formats like JSON

How Base64 Works

The encoding process groups binary data into chunks of 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 Base64 characters (6 bits each).

Common Use Cases

1. Email Attachments - MIME uses Base64 for email attachments
2. Data URLs - Embedding images directly in CSS or HTML
3. API Communication - Sending binary data over text-based protocols

Best Practices

- Use Base64 for small data only (it increases size by ~33%)
- Consider alternatives for large files
- Always validate decoded data
